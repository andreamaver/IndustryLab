The project consists in predicting the water level and the water flow of a laggon fed by five pitches, using features like temperature and quantity of rain. This could allow to manage this precious resource in a better way in these times of extreme Italian drought. To do so, multiple algorithms were tried with different configurations of features in order to find the best one at doing this task. Specifically, three times of methods were tried: statistical algorithms, machine learning methods and recurrent neural networks.

The data was provided by the professor and due to a confidentiality commitment it can't be spread online.

You can check out the full paper (available only in Italian) describing all the steps in great detail at: [Analisi bacino idrico](https://github.com/andreamaver/IndustryLab/blob/main/Braga_Maver_Bacino_idrico.pdf "Braga_Maver_Bacino_idrico.pdf").

  

In the [Notebooks](https://github.com/andreamaver/IndustryLab/tree/main/Notebooks) folder the Python scripts used for the project can be found, enumerated by their usage. The [Models](https://github.com/andreamaver/IndustryLab/tree/main/Models) folder stores all the models that were trained during the project developments.
